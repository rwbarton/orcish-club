\chapter{Opening bid structure}

In \fs, all hands with 16+ \hcp\ or 15 \hcp\ unbalanced or with a
5-card major open 1\c, \emph{except} 19--20 \bal\ hands, which open
2\nt.  The exception is to help us show balanced hands in competition,
by passing with a minimum hand and bidding cheaply in \nt\ with 21\+.
We may open 1\c\ with 13 or 14 \hcp\ hands of unusual playing
strength.  In \tf, all these ranges are 2 points higher.

We open most 10 \hcp\ hands in \fs.  The main exception is that we do
not open a balanced 10 when vulnerable.  Hands with a five-card major
open 1\h\ or 1\s, hands with six clubs open 2\c, hands with 4414,
(34)15, or 4405 shape open 2\d, and the remaining unbalanced hands
open 1\d.  Balanced hands open 1\nt\ with 10--12 when nonvulnerable,
1\d\ with 13--15; the ranges are reversed when vulnerable.

In \tf, our opening ranges are nominally all raised by 2 points.  In
3rd however it is almost impossible for responder to have an invite
opposite 12--16 without a good fit, so we may feel free to open with
10 or 11 \hcp\ and a reason to want to bid.  Our nonvulnerable
1\nt\ opening is 10--14 in 3rd and 13--14 in 4th.  The vulnerable
\tf\ 1\nt\ opening is a standard strong 15--17.

\chapter{The 1\c\ opening}

1\d\ is the negative response, normally 0--8 \hcp, but could contain a
stronger hand with fewer than 2 \ak.  1\h\+ is \gf, transfer-oriented
symmetric relay, promising 2 \ak.

\section{1\c--1\d}
1\h\ shows any 19\+ \hcp, 1\nt\ shows 16--18 \bal, and suit bids
from 1\s\ to 2\h\ are natural, 5 cards, 15--18 \hcp.  Opener uses his
discretion with (4441) shape.  2\s\+ do not exist.

\subsection{1\c--1\d--1\h}
1\s\ is a second negative showing 0--4 \hcp; 1\nt\+ is \gf,
transfer-oriented symmetric relay shifted up two steps, not promising
any \ak.

\subsubsection{1\c--1\d--1\h--1\s}
1\nt\ shows 21--23 \bal.  It's sort of silly that we end up in
1\nt\ with 21 opposite 0 but 2\nt\ with 20 opposite 0, but oh well.
Strong notrump systems are on (responder can certainly have a
game-forcing hand).

2\c\ is an artificial \gf.  Continuations are natural.

2\nt\ seems not to exist.

Suit bids from 2\d\ to 3\c\ are natural, and to the extent possible,
our agreements about auctions after 1\c--1\d--2\x\ apply here too.

\subsection{1\c--1\d--1\s}
We pretend that opener opened 1\s, except his range is now 15--18
rather than 10--14, and play our usual systems.  This is reasonable
since responder could have a game-forcing hand without a spade fit
(with 0--1 \ak).

\subsection{1\c--1\d--1\nt}
Strong notrump systems are on; again, responder could have a
game-forcing hand.

\subsection{1\c--1\d--2\x}
In general, continuations are mostly natural, except that 2\nt\ by
either hand is artificial showing a minimum hand in the context of the
auction.  It is a puppet to 3\c\ when it is responders first rebid, and
otherwise mostly forcing, but may be passed if a misfit seems likely.

With a bad hand, responder must either
\begin{itemize}
\item pass,
\item jump shift, or
\item bid 2\nt, and over the 3\c\ response, pass or correct to a suit
  below 3\x.
\end{itemize}

An exactly invitational hand with a 6\+-card suit \y\ above \x\ may
bid 2\nt\dots3\y, and an invitational hand with a ``fit'' for \x\ may
bid 2\nt\dots3\x\ (unless \x=\c; then responder must have an invite,
so opener should bid the lowest contract he's willing to play).  The
invitational raise is really just suggesting to play 3\x\ when the
invite is rejected; since we cannot play 2\nt\ this may not be a real
fit and opener should probably bid 3\nt\ even holding hearts.  That
covers the immediate 2\nt\ response by responder.  (The sequence
2\nt\dots3\nt\ is undefined.)

If responder does not make an initial jump shift or 2\nt\ response,
the auction is forcing to 2\nt\ by either player.  Bypassing 2\nt\ to
bid at the 3-level establishes a game force.  The artifical 2\nt\ is
not forcing; a minimum hand can pass but will more often pull to a
known fit or to 3\c\ to play in opener's second suit.  A maximum hand
bids above 3\x\ to establish a game force (this is why a hand which is
only invitational must start with 2\nt).

An initial 2\y\ over 2\x\ only shows a 4-card suit.  When we establish
a game force rather than bidding game directly, it tends to show doubt
over strain rather than level.  So 2\x--2\y--3\y\ will usually be a
3-card (\gf) raise.  Opener can make a minimum (3- or) 4-card raise
via 2\x--2\y--2\nt--3\c--3\y.  A jump shift to a new suit after
2\x--2\y\ is a splinter raise.  (Most of that assumes \y\ is a major.
When \x\ is \c\ and \y\ is \d, a raise to 3\d\ is probably a
suggestion to play 5\d, hence a real fit.)

\chapter{The weak 1\nt}

When nonvulnerable, 10--12 \bal\ in \fs, 10--14 in 3rd and 13--14 in
4th.  When vulnerable, 13--15 \bal\ in \fs.  (In \tf\ we play a strong
\nt, 15--17, with different systems.)

\section{Unpassed responder}
2\h/2\s\ to play, \dots.

\section{Passed responder}
We have 0--9 opposite at most 14 so there is no game.  Everything is
to play.

\chapter{The strong 1\nt}
1\nt\ opening showing 15--17 \bal\ in \tf\ when vulnerable, or
1\c--1\d--1\nt\ or 1\c--1\d--1\h--1\s--1\nt.

\chapter{The 2\nt\ opening}

19--20 \bal\ \fs, 21--22 \bal\ \tf.
